Hello! I'm Mikhail, a computer science and physics student at the University of British Columbia graduating in May 2025.

My interests include software and application development, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.

I earned a degree with distinction in chemical engineering from the University of British Columbia in 2021. I have 3 years of work experience in natural and biogas industries in the capacity of process engineer.

I'm currently looking for co-op opportunities beginning in September 2024.
